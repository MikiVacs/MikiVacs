- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikiVacs. I am with a Seattle-based marketing and product development company called Apexant.com
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating with developers who might wish to leverage their existing code/application to quickly sell into a new market. We would then share in the revenue and any type of custom (NRE) development work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- 💞️ I am a serial entrepreneur. I want to work with a developer to leverage what you might have already created (with minimal tweaks/updates needed) so that we can get to market faster and share in the revenue stream. I'm mainly interested in SaaS solutions, but let me know if you have developed on other platforms (e.g., Mobile Apps, or Windows-based). I am located in the Seattle area, and my core focus is marketing and distribution. I am willing to pay the customization work if needed. If you are interested, please let me know.
- 📫 How to reach me - miki"at"apexant.com (or miki.vacs"at"gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Also, if you have clients in the US or Canada who need local support, I can help you with project management efforts as well — basically, local client communications and support (planning, product/projects requirements, development (Agile/Scrum), delivery, maintenance, and local support).
